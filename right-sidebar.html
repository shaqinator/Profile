										</header>
										<p>The Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.</p>

											<center><h3><strong>Learning Type</strong></h3></center>
										</header>
										<p>Have you ever wondered why you do better in some classes than others? It may depend on your individual learning style. Your learning style influences the way you understand information and solve problems. There are three primary learning styles: Visual, Auditory and Tactile.Many people use a combination of learning styles, whereas others learn best by using just one.</p>
										<p>As you can see from my results, I utilise a mixture of Auditory and Visual learning, with Tactile learning only making up a small portion of my learning style.</p>

											<center><h3><strong>The Big Five Personality Test</strong></h3></center>
										</header>
										<p>The Big Five (also called Five Factor) model of personality is the most widely accepted personality theory in the scientific community. Although it is not as well understood among laypeople as systems like Myers-Briggs personality typing, it is generally believed to be the most scientifically sound way of conceptualizing the differences between people. The Big Five is so named because the model proposes that human personality can be measured along five major dimensions, each of which is distinct and independent from the others. The Big Five model is also sometimes called OCEAN or CANOE, both acronyms of the five traits. In the Big Five model, people are understood to have varying levels of key personality factors which drive our thoughts and behavior. Although personality traits cannot specifically predict behavior, differences in the Big Five factors help us to understand why people may react differently, behave differently, and see things differently from others in the same situation.</p>

											<h3><strong>Meaning</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>As I have undertaken a range of these tests over the years, the results of these tests don't deliver much that I wasn't aware of. These tests provide a very accurate description of myself, how I operate and the personality traits I hold.</p>

											<h3><strong>Team Behaviours</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>Whilst I am most suited to a leadership position as evidenced by my Myers-Briggs results, I also operate with an extremely open mind and find I am adaptable to fit into any role allocated to me. I'm diplomatic and like to facilitate the smooth runnings of a project, ensuring I do my best to fill gaps that appear in the teams capability.</p>

											<h3><strong>Forming a Team</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>When forming a team, I take into account the other personalities that surround me and do my best to work to those personality strengths. Its important to focus on the outcome from the very beginning and make sure that any potential personality clashes are mitigated at the start to ensure successful delivery.</p>
