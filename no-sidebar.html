										<br />
										<p>Something that often arises in conversation, living in a city with lots of parking at different prices is that there is desire from the public to be able easily check pricing prior to their travel journey. The trouble is, for customers, its necessary to either search individual carparks for pricing or physically attend a car park to view their pricing board (most of the time, far to difficult of a situation to back out and change your mind). A solution to this problem would be an app that allows customers to search nearby parking or parking in a certain location. Not only showing them the location of the parking, but available pricing for their intended duration. This would allow users to shop around, as they do for fuel and give them the ability to save money.</p>
										<p>This product would have a map-like interface that would center on the customer’s location, like Uber. It would give the user the option to input their destination and from there, be shown pins that would indicate different car parks that allow for public parking. The customer would be able to select different locations and view their duration-based pricing. From there, they would be able to select an option to bookmark their favourite carparks. There would also be an added capability to navigate to the user’s selected carpark. With the right business development managers, agreements could be made with said carparks to allow or the user to book and pay for their parking via the app. Additionally, customers would be able to rate the carparks they attend based on service, time taken to enter and find a park, time taken to exit and pricing for the type of parking. The app would also have an NFC function that would allow you to tap upon entry and exit (for carparks without Registration Recognition) to make service seamless.</p>
										<p>Requirements would be different depending on the budget of the project. If this was a self-undertaken development, then I would expect that I would utilise MIT App Builder due to my inexperience with developing applications. It would require app development to utilise location services and NFC technology. If the project had higher funding capability, then I would hire a UX / UI designer to design the application, an app developer with skills in both Android and iOS to develop the app for both platforms, a marketing manager to undertake advertising and a business development manager to make agreements with carparking vendors.</p>
										<p>For Android, the Android Studio would be utilised which would be open sourced. The person developing would simply need a suitable computer to conduct the development on. This can be found <a href="https://www.ithands.com/blog/5-ios-app-development-tools/">here</a>. There are a range of developments software that can be used, this is just an example. For iOS, there is also a range of favoured application development software that can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">here</a>. We would also utilise a range of social media platforms to advertise the product for both launch and ongoing customer generation. As with most apps, in-app advertising would be the primary source of income, users would be able to pay a small price to have the adverts removed. Additionally, carpark vendors would be able to pay a fee (monthly) to have their carpark have a “favoured” status on the app. </p>
										<p>Should this project be successful, users would be able to quickly and easily find parking that meets their location needs but also their pricing needs as well. It would become a platform for users to rate carparks and provide information about the facilities that would mean users could make an educated decision around where they park and what they would pay.</p>
