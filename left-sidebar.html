											<center><h3>Cyber Security - Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC)</h3></center>
										</header>
										<p>Something I've always been interested in, is the effects of changing technology on the ever-changing risks to our government and society. I have had signficant exposure to the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) due to previous work in Government Vetting and have been interested in furthering my knowledge into the technology and cyber aspect via the Information Security Manual (ISM) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).</p>
										<p>This role would allow me to provide advisory services to the Federal Government around their cyber security risk management, governance, policy and process specific to their context, their risks and compliance needs. It would allow me to affect change in improving the level of security assurance for departments that have a need to protect information both internally and that which is transacted from third parties. </p>
										<p>Currently, the relevant skills and qualifications that I have are more from a policy perspective, having worked in Vetting, the work centers around policy. I have worked in specialist IT recruitment for Federal Government over the last 3 years and have had significant exposure to the various pathways that both permanent and contract resources take in the IT industry. This pathway struck my interest due to the ability to expand on the knowledge I already have and apply it to a more technical pathway within IT.</p>
										<p>Beginning my Bachelor of Information Technology, I have begun my journey in that direction. From here, I plan to pursue a Masters of Cyber Security and certify in both Compliance and Risk Management, as well as become a part of the Information Security Registered Assessor (IRAP) Program. Once my Bachelor's is complete, I will look to gain employment within a Cyber Security company to begin gainin experience in the field.</p>

											<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I grew up around technology and have always worked in jobs that have centered around technology. My interest started as a kid, assisting a close family member in assembling and disassembling computers. I worked in IT sales for a number of years and now in recruitment.</p>

											<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Growing up in Victoria in my earlier years, RMIT was always the university that stood out as the epitome of technology tertiary education in Australia. It was exciting to hear I was accepted this year!</p>

											<h3>What do I expect to learn?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I know technology is constantly changing, and so much has changed and grown since I was first exposed to IT. What I'd like to gain over the course of the next few years is a base understanding of a broad range of topics within IT to be able to make a sound decision on my career direction. Although I feel I have chosen my path, this could change.</p>
